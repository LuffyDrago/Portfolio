# Portfolio🥂 - New Beginnings✨
I built this website to showcase some of my skills!


## Welcome! 👋

## Tools! 🛠️

    For this challenge, I used...

    React  (to build out the site)
    styled-components (to style it)
    
    React Router, ScrollTrigger (for the page transitions and animations)


## Motivation 🚀

To polish up my learning skills React, React Router and Stled Components, and I thought this my Portfolio design is the perfect way to apply what I've learned so far.

## Installation

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

In the project directory, you can run: npm start to run the app in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
   

## Learning Outcomes❗
This was my first time using all of these libraries/packages (besides React), so I learned a lot! Besides learning those new tools, I realized how important it is to stay organized and write code that is clean and reusable, especially as the project you're working on grows larger. 🙂
